This is a website meant to be the main website for the two-piece band I Don't Know How But They Found Me after the release of theit latest album, Razzmatazz. The website takes a lot of inspiration from the colour scheme of the album and tries to stay loyal to the theme that the band has. The website would allow fans to gain more insight to the band in both pictorial and text form. It also features the store in the main page to encourage fans to visit the main store.

The website is aimed at advertising the band's new album, giving new fans an idea of the aesthetics of the band, and giving existing fans a dose of new videos and lore that contribute to the band's image.
 
## Design Process
This website is made for a band which started a few years ago and is still in the process of growing their discography and fanbase. I fist looked at their [actual page](https://idkhow.com/). It is very focused on the lore of the band and newer fans might be confused (with the white figure that appears at the bottom). The website I made is aimed at making the website understandable for the masses and maybe make the band more appealing. It also advertises their merch a lot more to get fans' attention.

- As a new fan, I want to learn more about the band to understand their music more (about page is helpful)
- As an existing fan, I want to find more details on the band members and get more photos of them, I also want to be more involved with the band (about and gallery page, newsletter to get involved)
- As a complete outsider (e.g. news reporter, parent of fan), I want to find out what the band is like, so as to decide whether I want to keep listening / get an opinion on them (spotify and apple are embedded in the home page with the main single of the album for convenience)
- As someone looking for when they are touring, I want to find out where they are touring so I can buy a ticket. (tour page)

### Features Left to Implement

- Intergrate more of the band's lore / origin story into the website through images in the background and links to unlisted youtube videos to keep fans engaged
- Use the band's instagram feed for images in the gallery page rather than avng to update them manually to ensure fans can get the most up-to-date content from the website
- Make the band member's images change automatically in the about page to make returns to the website more interesting
- Make hamburger menu instead of menu at the top
## Technologies Used
- [html](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)
    - The project uses **HTML** to build the structure of the website.
- [css](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/)
    - The project uses **CSS** to do the presentation of the website.


## Testing
1. Newsletter:
    1. Go to any page except shop
    2. Submitting form without name or email address would result in an error
    3. Submitting form with name field including anything but capital and small letters would result in an error
    4. Submmitting the form with the email field not written properly would result in an error
    5. Not changing the continent field would submit the default, North America (the newsletters would mail based on north american time zone)

I used @media to change the font-size and line-height become larger and easier to read for tablets and phones. I also used it to resize flexboxes and images. so that they were more pleasing to the eye.
